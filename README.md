## What is it?
Have you ever wanted to learn topics such as electronics and scripting? But you haven't bothered because it was too much to take on or every resource was paid?

STEMe plans to tackle that problem. This tool allows you to learn - completely for free - on your laptop or desktop with short lessons. 

There is no premium feature, everything is available to the public and is open source too under the MIT license.


## Installation
Install [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/) then download the `main.rb` file. After downloading the `main.rb` file, find which directory it is located in then run `ruby main.rb` in your terminal or double click on the `main.rb` file. That's it!
