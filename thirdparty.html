    <p>Ruby is copyrighted free software by Yukihiro Matsumoto <matz@netlab.jp>.
        <br>
        You can redistribute it and/or modify it under either the terms of the
        <br>
        2-clause BSDL (see the file BSDL), or the conditions below:
        <br>
        1. You may make and give away verbatim copies of the source form of the
           software without restriction, provided that you duplicate all of the
           original copyright notices and associated disclaimers.
        <br>
        2. You may modify your copy of the software in any way, provided that
           you do at least ONE of the following:
           <br>
           a. place your modifications in the Public Domain or otherwise
              make them Freely Available, such as by posting said
              modifications to Usenet or an equivalent medium, or by allowing
              the author to include your modifications in the software.
              <br>
           b. use the modified software only within your corporation or
              organization.
              <br>
           c. give non-standard binaries non-standard names, with
              instructions on where to get the original software distribution.
              <br>
           d. make other distribution arrangements with the author.
           <br>
        3. You may distribute the software in object code or binary form,
           provided that you do at least ONE of the following:
           <br>
           a. distribute the binaries and library files of the software,
              together with instructions (in the manual page or equivalent)
              on where to get the original distribution.
              <br>
           b. accompany the distribution with the machine-readable source of
              the software.
              <br>
           c. give non-standard binaries non-standard names, with
              instructions on where to get the original software distribution.
              <br>
           d. make other distribution arrangements with the author.
           <br>
        4. You may modify and include the part of the software into any other
           software (possibly commercial).  But some files in the distribution
           are not written by the author, so that they are not under these terms.
           <br>
           For the list of those files and their copying conditions, see the
           file LEGAL (https://github.com/ruby/ruby/blob/master/LEGAL).
           <br>
        5. The scripts and library files supplied as input to or produced as
           output from the software do not automatically fall under the
           copyright of the software, but belong to whomever generated them,
           and may be sold commercially, and may be aggregated with this
           software.
